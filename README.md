            to any privileges or penalties pertaining to the space on which you
            land. Retaining the dice, throw again and move your token as before.
            If you throw doubles three times in succession, move your token

              on Chance, and draws the &quot;<b>Advance to GO</b>&quot; card, they collect
              $200 for passing GO the first time, and another $200 for Advancing

            unowned property you may buy that property from the Bank at its
            printed price. You receive the Title Deed card showing ownership.
            Place the title deed card face up in front of you. If you do not
            wish to buy the property, the Bank sells it at through an auction to
            the highest bidder. The high bidder pays the Bank the amount of the

              When a property is mortgaged, its Title Deed card is placed face

            all the Title Deed cards in a color-group (i.e., Boardwalk and Park
            Place, or Connecticut, Vermont and Oriental Avenues) because the
            owner may then charge double rent for unimproved properties in that
            colour-group. This rule applies to unmortgaged properties even if
            another property in that colour-group is mortgaged.<br>It is even
            more advantageous to have houses or hotels on properties because
            rents are much higher than for unimproved properties. The owner may
            not collect the rent if they fail to ask for it before the second
            player following throws the dice.<br><br></font><br>

            deck. The &quot;<b>Get Out of Jail Free</b>&quot; card is held until used and
            then returned to the bottom of the deck. If the player who draws it

            size=1>Top of Page</font></a><br><br><font size="2">Unimproved properties can
            be mortgaged through the Bank at any time. Before an improved
            property can be mortgaged, all the buildings on all the properties
            of its colour-group must be sold back to the Bank at half price. The
            mortgage value is printed on each Title Deed card.<br><br>No rent
            can be collected on mortgaged properties or utilities, but rent can
            be collected on unmortgaged properties in the same group.<br><br>In
            order to lift the mortgage, the owner must pay the Bank the amount
            of mortgage <i>plus</i> 10% interest. When all the properties of a
            colour-group are no longer mortgaged, the owner may begin to buy back
            houses at full price.<br><br>The player who mortgages property
            retains possession of it and no other player may secure it by
            lifting the mortgage from the Bank. However, the owner may sell this
            mortgaged property to another player at any agreed price. If you are
            the new owner, you may lift the mortgage at once if you wish by
            paying off the mortgage plus 10% interest to the Bank. If the
            mortgage is not lifted at once, you must pay the Bank 10% interest
            when you buy the property and if you lift the mortgage later you
            must pay the Bank an additional 10% interest as well as the amount
            of the mortgage.<br><br></font><br>
            <a name="bankruptcy"></a><b><u>BANKRUPTCY</u></b><br><a href="#top"><font
            size=1>Top of Page</font></a><br><br><font size="2">You are declared bankrupt
            if you owe more than you can pay either to another player or to the
            Bank. If your debt is to another player, you must turn over to that
            player all that you have of value and retire from the game.<br>In
            making this settlement, if you own houses or hotels, you must return
            these to the Bank in exchange for money to the extent of one-half
            the amount paid for them.<br>This cash is given to the creditor. If
            you have mortgaged property you also turn this property over to your
            creditor but the new owner must at once pay the Bank the amount of
            interest on the loan, which is 10% of the value of the
            property.<br>The new owner who does this may then, at their option,
            pay the principal or hold the property until some later turn, then
            lift the mortgage. If they hold property in this way until a later
            turn, they must pay the interest again upon lifting the
            mortgage.<br>Should you owe the Bank, instead of another player,
            more than you can pay (because of taxes or penalties) even by
            selling off buildings and mortgaging property, you must turn over
            all assets to the Bank. In this case, the Bank immediately sells by
            auction all property so taken, except buildings. A bankrupt player
            must immediately retire from the game. The last player left in the
            game wins.<br><br></font><br>

            rules for this Short Game.<br>1. During <b>PREPARATION</b> for play,
            the Banker shuffles the pack of Title Deed cards, then the player to
            the left cuts them, then the Banker deals out two, one at a time, to
            each player. The players must immediately pay the Bank the printed
            price of each. Play then begins as in the regular game.<br>2. In
            this short game, it is necessary to have only three houses<i>
            (instead of four)</i> on each lot of a complete colour-group before
            the player may buy a hotel.<br>Rent for a hotel remains the same as
            in the regular game.<br>The turn-in value of a hotel is still
            one-half the purchase price, which in this game is one house fewer
            than in the regular game. <br>3. <b>END OF GAME.</b> The first
            player to go bankrupt retires from play, as in the regular game.
            However, when the second bankruptcy occurs, the game ends. Play
            immediately ceases, with the bankrupt player's turning over to there
            creditor all that they have of value, including buildings and any
            other properties.<br>This happens whether the creditor is a rival
            player or the Bank.<br>Each remaining player then values his/her
            property.<br>
            <i>(1) Cash on hand <br>(2) Lots, Utilities and Railroads
              owned, at the price printed on the board.<br>(3) Any mortgaged
              property owned, at one-half the price printed on the board.
              <br>(4) Houses, valued at purchase price.<br>(5) Hotels, valued at
              purchase price including the value of the<br>three houses turned
